# borealis

Controller and TV oriented UI library for Android, iOS, PC, PS4, PSV and Nintendo Switch.

- Mimicks the Nintendo Switch system UI, but can also be used to make anything else painlessly
- Hardware acceleration and vector graphics with automatic scaling for TV usage (powered by nanovg)
- Can be ported to new platforms and graphics APIs by providing a nanovg implementation
- Powerful layout engine using flex box as a base for everything (powered by Yoga Layout)
- Automated navigation paths for out-of-the-box controller navigation
- Out of the box touch support
- Define user interfaces using XML and only write code when it matters
- Use and restyle built-in components or make your own from scratch
- Display large amount of data efficiently using recycling lists
- Integrated internationalization and storage systems
- Integrated toolbox (logger, animations, timers, background tasks...)
